# Create the DataFrame flights
flights = spark.table("flights")

# Show the head
flights.show()

# Add duration_hrs
flights = flights.withColumn("duration_hrs", flights.air_time/60)
# Now you can make new columns derived from the old ones!
------------

# Filter flights by passing a string
long_flights1 = flights.filter("distance > 1000")

# Filter flights by passing a column of boolean values
long_flights2 = flights.filter(flights.distance > 1000)

# Print the data to check they're equal
long_flights1.show()
long_flights2.show()
# PySpark often provides a few different ways to get the same results.
